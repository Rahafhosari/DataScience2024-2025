# Project 1

Project one explores the data set of Item Sales. Which can be found here [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e_L_dHlYAh3Fr37fkePH2muBVq92QfeB]


The project was worked first by data cleaning and second by Data Visualising.

Data Visualization:-
## Heatmap
The heatmap displays the correlation matrix of numerical features in the dataset, 
with each square representing the correlation coefficient between two features.

---- 
## Histogram 
The plot here Item Weight Histogram shows the distribution of item weights in the dataset.  
The x-axis represents the weight of the items assuming in kilograms, 
and the y-axis represents the number of items with that weight.

As it can be seen the shape of the distribution indicates a concentration of item weights within a certain range.
The presence of -1 (data below zero) indicates the placeholder values used for missing data, 
which was done in the data preparation and cleaning part.
